Your Majesty,

Per your request what follows is a general summary of site XCVII and department containment measures.

## Site

The site is an open-cut mine in the mountainous rainforest area of Western Tasmania. The nearby town is populated entirely by rotating shift workers at the mine.

On the morning of `October 13, 2010` excavator operator encounters a large object while digging earth in central pit. It had been partially uncovered before the miners realised it was a NASA shuttle. By the time we were aware it was already local news and too many people knew for total denial be viable (see Protocol).

## Shuttle

The craft in question is the Space Shuttle *Challenger*. It is fully intact and upright, intersecting the boundary of two geological strata. Equipment and people coming into physical contact seem to "phase" through it and report no pain or other effects. However the removal of machinery or limbs from "inside" the object reveals inserted matter is completely severed at the contact point.

## Reality Management

Our friends at `Murdoch Media` were directed to disseminate a story about a gas leak at the mine. Forgers manipulated the real photo and video footage by adding telltale signs of fabrication to allow them to be "debunked" with time. Miners are now a source of mockery with some first-hand witnesses even doubting their own memories. We are observing the situation and will enhance our technique if and when necessary.

Lastly, there remains the nasty matter of the persistent Marchioness Loretta Harding (TX) who has employed a private investigator. As her inquiries are yet to be made public I regret to counsel `that we assassinate her` and her PI before there's a chance for either to cause a scene.
