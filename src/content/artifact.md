## Immovable Artifacts

At times artifacts are too large to be moved (in example, `the Nebraska Monolith`) or too dangerous. In other instances, such as site XCVII, the object is simply impossible to interact with.

In this circumstance one must divise a practical solution to contain the artifact and prevent contamination. Additionally there is a need to provide an explanation that the public mind can accept.

## Mobile Artifacts

If the artifact is able to be moved then do so. Secure the appropriate route, team, and vehicle(s) by which it will be conveyed. After the `Shanghai Torch` incident agents may no longer use their discretion with regards to shielding â€” forward the required dimensions to the local field office and they will be supplied.

Finally, one must consider how the transportation process appears to an outsider. Exercise care not to raise the suspicions of local law enforcement or the public.
