## The Seraph Programme

Almost any video footage that is transmitted over a network at some point is stored in a datacenter. Storage, de-duplication, and geotagging are the only processes the footage goes through due to hardware limitations. Seraph cannot be used in real-time to identify targets. However it can be retroactively searched once agents have a query to feed it.

Footage sources include traffic lights, car cameras, e-Doorbells, satellite footage, business and government building CCTV, phones, video calls, news archives, refridgerators and so on. Some footage is instantly transferred and captured. Other footage, such as CCTV, is captured during off site back-up processes.
