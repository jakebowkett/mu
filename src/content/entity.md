## `Entity Code Name X`

While it cannot be confirmed it seems intuitive that `Entity X` which takes the form of `Neil Armstrong` and the artifact at site XCVII being a space shuttle are related.

`Entity X` moves as if subjected to `low gravity` like that on `the moon`. Its appearance is preceded by a "ping" of sorts akin to submarine sonar. Reports also exist of `astronaut boot footprints` and `a motionless pre-Democratic Empire flag` being discovered in the minutes prior to an encounter but these are secondhand accounts. Only one suvivor exists.

## Counter-Measures

There appears to be no effective form of resistance besides total avoidance. Synthesis of testimony suggests there is a long window before `Entity X` appears. Perhaps it is possible to escape during this period. As only one person is taken at a time individuals may get lucky but there is no known criteria for whom will be chosen.

Once a visual is possible it is too late. `The entity` becomes stuck in a fixed point of onlooker's fields of view â€” turning one's head or closing one's eyes cannot stop it from being seen. Upon contact both the target and `the entity` immediately disappear.

The lack of survivors may indicate a tendency for `Entity X` to return for previous onlookers.

## Survivor

`Yvonne Kelly` was found wandering back into town in a daze. Her strange descriptions were reported in the local news which was in turn scraped and processed by *Operation Wall Fly* (see On Monitoring). Further investigation and an interview subsequently confirmed her encounter to be with `Entity X`.

She was taken into custody to prevent any information leakage. A series of pyschological and physical tests have been run on her but were inconclusive. Subject finds recollection of event extremely stressful. Containment procedures usually reserved for `supra entities` have been enacted as a precaution in case she became contaminated during her meeting.

`Kelly` was able to escape during the facility breach in `November`. Her location is known but inaccessible to us. Teams adept enough to navigate the town are too valuable to risk losing for such a low value target.
