## Operation Wall Fly

While important newsrooms have their stories pre-screened for anomolies (as well as message deviance) it is not a practical way to deal with the total volumne of stories each day. Therefore data is scraped from public networks and automatically analysed to discover potential leads on `supranatural` activity.

This process allows discovery of problematic pieces by lesser outlets that must be recontextualised in the public mind. Many of these outlets cater to an audience of bumpkins that will explain happenings according to their own local mythos. In such circumstances the goal is to facilitate a conversation of "tradition" vs "science", in essence setting the boundaries of how given events can be perceived.

The "tradition" explanation often comes ready-made and is easily brought forth through a gentle antagonism of existing local tensions. Familial feuds, pagan wrath, and the like are examples. The "science" explanation could emerge naturally from resident contrarians but that should not be counted upon. There will always be stories ready to seed - in example:

* Suggest the fallibility of the human senses and make connections to similar (and fabricated if necessary) events appearing to concern `the supranatural` but ultimately having a rational explanation.
* Plant historical evidence of falsehoods put forth by people taking undesirable stances on events. Allow discontent to approach its apex then "reveal" the sordid past. Followers must be made to feel sheepish about making future demands for fear of being associated.
* And so forth.

Agents are presented with an interface that allows them to quickly sift through the large volume of discoveries. Each entry contains annotations listing the reason they were flagged, similar entries in the same region, and so forth. It is up to the agent to use their training to read between the lines of the seemingly ordinary.
