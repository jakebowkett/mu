## Basic Principles

The monitoring programme achieves its goal of total knowledge through actions which vary from cooperation with other agencies, spying, infiltration, SIGINT, the proxy activities of assets and informants, _et cetera_.

Yet it would be a mistake to view these specific methods in isolation. An advantageous position is not maintained solely through technology and force but through the judicious application of strategy when commanding them.

At times it is better to accept an immediate defeat to realise a higher end. In example, consider a case where the apprehension of one ignoble fool would reveal the technique by which they were caught to the whole realm of criminals. It is not wise to show one's hand simply to punish a single low life if restraint can bring about the total destruction of their organisation at a future date.

Further consider that enemies who perceive common threats will eventually pursue common aims. The disparate groupings of this society coming to understand that they are each targetted alike could unified them. The population is best managed through segregation into sub-populations whose tensions can be stoked to maintain a balance of power.

Lastly, one must fully comprehend that the ordinary dictates of propriety cannot apply in this sacred line of duty. All that God allows must be done in service of Him.
